<li>Do NOT use a regular instant pot. It must be a 15

<li>If you have an Instant Pot Max (discontinued), that works too.</li>
<li>If you can’t afford this, a stovetop pressure cooker which can reach
    15 psi is also a good option. A regular Instant Pot <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0208769">can potentially work</a>, but you
    would need to run the sterilization cycle for at least 2.5 hours
    instead of 1 hour.</li>

</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WSRLD95/">Instant Pot Mesh Steamer</a><ol>
<li>Optional. Nice for keeping vials higher up in the

<li>If you want to filter more than 30mL of vials, you
    can buy 60mL syringes instead. 60mL syringes also make it even less
    likely to break the filter due to lower achievable pressure, but
    filtering may be slower as a result.</li>

<li>If you want to filter more than 2-3 vials or don’t
    want to buy the still air box, also buy large vials (20-100mL)
    enough to fit all of the solution you intend to filter from the
    above link.</li>
<li>Tip! Smaller vials are less likely to get
    contaminated or cored from multiple reuses. Since you are doing the
    work here, there’s no major reason not to use vials smaller than
    10mL. You may have to draw from a 10mL vial over 78 times!</li>
<li>Tip! Amber vs Clear vials: Clear vials are easier
    to inspect for particulates or discoloration of the vial contents.
    Amber vials protect their contents from light making it less likely
    to degrade, but you won’t be able to check for discoloration prior
    to drawing.</li>

<h2 id="avoiding-filter-breakage">Avoiding Filter Breakage</h2>
<p>Syringe filters can break if you apply too much
pressure to them. An easy way to avoid this is to use a syringe which is
large. I personally cannot apply more than 63 psi of force to a 30 mL
syringe, meaning it is physically impossible for me to exceed the
syringe filter’s 100 psi limit.</p>
<p>A way you can test if you can physically exceed the
syringe filter’s rated pressure is to do the bubble point test procedure
outlined later in this document, but do it with an extra syringe or a
used one after filtering. Plug the end with your finger and press as
hard as possible, and then do the conversion to determine how much
pressure you can exert.</p>
<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>If you have a still air box, set it up now and do all
of these steps inside of it. Wear gloves and wipe them down with an
alcohol swab.</p>
<h3 id="ipa-rinse">IPA Rinse</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use the isopropyl alcohol to rinse the inside and
    outside of all your pre-filter supplies:<ol>
<li>100mL Beaker</li>
<li>Stir Bar</li>
<li>1x Weight Boat</li>
<li>API measuring lab spatula</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make sure all of the IPA is dried off before using
    the items. If you accidentally get IPA into your mixture, it will
    evaporate out due to heating and stirring, but it is best to not
    allow this to happen in the first place.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mixing">Mixing</h3>
<p>There are four formulations which I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estradiol Enanthate 10mL 40 mg/mL<ul>
<li>400 mg Estradiol Enanthate</li>
<li>0.2 mL Benzyl Alcohol</li>
<li>9.44 mL MCT Oil or Castor Oil</li>
<li>Note: Castor oil is extremely slow to filter (6 hrs
    per 10mL) and requires the vacuum hack. It may be less likely to
    irritate you injected subq if you have issues with MCT oil. Grape
    seed oil may also be worth trying, if you have luck with grape seed
    but not MCT oil please tell me!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Estradiol Enanthate 10mL 50 mg/mL<ul>
<li>500 mg Estradiol Enanthate</li>

<p>To produce a batch, multiply the recipe above by the
number of vials you want. You will likely lose about a half a 5mL vial
due to dead space.</p>
<p><strong>Benzyl Alcohol is not optional.</strong> Some homebrewers make and inject without benzyl alcohol
preservative in their vials. While we are doing everything we can to
prevent biological contamination of our vials, both filtering and heat
sterilization may not be completely effective. Additionally, the multi
dose vial is contaminated with small amounts of air each time you inject
air into the vial before drawing a dose. The benzyl alcohol could
potentially be the last line of defense between you and a serious
infection.</p>
<p><strong>Benzyl Benzoate</strong> is a solvent which can be used to increase solubility of API in your recipes.
We don't use any in our recipes, but it is commonly used to increase solubility for people who use
estradiol valerate or have issues with API crashing out of solution with some MCT oils. It is not
a preservative, you must use Benzyl Alcohol too regardless. It is commonly suspected to cause
irritation, but we suspect that MCT oil is also associated with irritation too and suggest castor oil
to avoid that risk if you have problems. Benzyl Benzoate is usually used at a concentration of 20-44%,
depending on how much API you need to dissolve, what the API is, and how well your carrier oil holds API.</p>

    or already added benzyl alcohol, use the lowest temperature possible,
    not exceeding 140 °F (60 °C).</li>
<li>Once it looks like the powder is dissolved,
    continue stirring for 30 minutes to ensure complete dissolution and
    avoid loss of API.</li>

<li>Grab one of the 30mL or 60mL syringes and fit an
    18g drawing needle onto it.</li>
<li>Draw up the solution out of the beaker.<ol>
<li>Make sure to inject air into the vials while
    drawing to avoid pulling a vacuum. You want the entire vial to go
    into the syringe, so you may need to alternate between drawing and
    injecting more air.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there is any air left in your syringe, now is
    the time to push it out.</li>
<li>Remove the 18g needle. Do not re-use this needle
    in the next part.</li>
<li>Obtain another new 18g needle.</li>
<li>Unwrap a syringe filter and place the needle on the
    output side (luer slip side) of the syringe filter.</li>
<li>Install the syringe filter onto your
    syringe.</li>
<li>You have two main options for filtering. If you are
    filtering more than 20mL of solution, want to take breaks, or don’t
    have a still air box, continue with this procedure. Otherwise, you
    can directly fill vials from the syringe filter by skipping to step
    2 in the next section.</li>
<li>Unwrap a third 18g needle and stick it into your
    intermediate filtering vial directly, not attached to any syringe.
    This vial is 20-100mL depending on how much solution you want to
    filter.</li>
<li>Insert the syringe filter needle into the vial. Now
    just push on the syringe.<ol>
<li>This can take a while, about 10 minutes per vial.
    If needed, you can take breaks. I suggest switching between hands
    while filtering.</li>
<li>This may sound awful, and it is, but you only have
    to do it once every few years. If you want to mass produce vials,
    consider using vacuum filtration instead. You can also get some of
    the advantages by doing the “vacuum syringe filtering” tutorial at
    the end of this document.</li>
<li>If you are filtering more than 25 mL of solution,
    you may need to switch out additional syringe filters. This mostly
    depends on if the flow rate decreases and your level of

<h2 id="bubble-point-testing">Bubble Point Testing</h2>
<p><a href="../hrtcat/guide/7-bubble-point.html">HRT Cat</a>, the instructions this
bubble point test procedure is based on, claims that bubble point values
are readily available for MCT oil on the manufacturer website. I haven’t
found these values reported for any of the filters I have used or
researched and my own testing suggests the specific liquid used greatly
influences the test results.  If you want to do this test, you need to
also do it on a fresh filter which has been flushed with MCT oil (or
your carrier oil of choice) and compare. If you are using a solvent,
make sure to include that in the test fluid.</p>
<p>Two tests for the filters I linked with MCT oil resulted in 65 psi and
59 psi. A test with Castor oil resulted in 196 psi. Note that if you
test the filter multiple times, subsequent tests may not be valid as the
filter may cease to be completely wet with the test fluid. I suggest
using 10mL syringes. 5mL syringes are too small to be accurate and 30mL
syringes you likely won’t be able to exert the required pressure unless
you are very strong. The bubble point value reported for 0.22 micron
Nylon filters for water is 40-46 psi. <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/279/286/bubblepoint-an4364en-ms.pdf">This document</a> as well as my own
experiments show the bubble point is highly dependent on the liquid
being tested.</p>

<li>If you are outside the US, your weather reporting
    may use different pressure units.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ensure there is an 18g needle on your syringe

<li>Remove the syringe filter from the syringe you were
    using to filter from.</li>
<li>Obtain a new or used 10mL syringe and fill it with
    air up to 10mL.</li>
<li>Attach the syringe to the syringe filter.</li>
<li>Fill a small glass or bowl with water.</li>
<li>Dip the needle into the water and press on the
    syringe slowly.</li>
<li>When a steady stream of bubbles is emitted from the
    syringe (not every few seconds, constant bubbles), record the value
    on the syringe.</li>
<li>Use Boyle’s Law to calculate the pressure from the

<li>Initial volume: 10mL</li>
<li>Final volume: The volume recorded from step
    9.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To calculate manually:<ol>
<li>Multiply the initial pressure from the weather
    forecast by 10 mL.</li>
<li>Divide that result by the volume recorded from step
    9.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The resulting value from the conversion is known as
    the bubble point.<ol>
<li>If this value is <em>significantly</em> lower (like around half) than the bubble point from
    either the filter specification or a fresh filter, it means your
    filter has been compromised and the solution you filtered is likely
    not sterile.</li>
<li>If the value is similar to the expected bubble
    point, it means you didn’t break your filter and your solution has
    been correctly filtered.</li>
<li>Note that this procedure is an estimate and is not
    extremely accurate.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="inspection-and-labeling">Inspection and Labeling</h2>
<p>Give your vials some time to allow air bubbles to
dissipate and look for evidence of dust contamination. If the vials are
contaminated, you should consider re-filtering and investigating how
your vials were contaminated. You should also label your vials with
their ingredients, a batch number, and an expiration date after
determining the vials pass a visual inspection.</p>
<p>You should record the batch numbers of any oils and
excipients used along with the batch number in a compounding log. Castor
oil solutions can last 2-5 years and MCT Oil solutions can last 3-8
years from the date of manufacture for the oil. The higher numbers are
theoretical, require ideal storage, and exceed recommended use times for
the oil by the manufacturer. Vials should be stored in a dark place free
of excessive heat, as light and excessive heat exposure speed up
degradation. If you freeze your vials in an attempt to extend shelf
life, you may need to place them into boiling water to re-dissolve any
API which precipitates out.</p>
<p>If you are considering selling your vials, please be aware this practice
could be highly illegal in your area and would put you at serious risk.
Should you decide to do so anyways, testing the contents of your vials
through a service such as <a href="https://janoshik.com/">Janoshik</a> is highly recommended.
It is out of the scope of this guide to advise people how to conduct an
illegal business. Stay safe out there.</p>
<h2 id="caulk-gun-filtering">Caulk Gun Filtering</h2>
<p>This method is cheaper, easier, and 3x faster than vacuum syringe filtering, however
it requires a degree of periodic monitoring of the caulk gun and if you
are inattentive and make a mistake it is easy to rupture the syringe filter.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to have an air bubble in the syringe which you compress with
the caulk gun. It is EXTREMELY important that you do not directly drive the fluid
through the syringe withe the caulk gun, instead you are compressing an air bubble
which drives the fluid through the syringe. You will periodically compress the
syringe more as filtering progresses.</p>
<p>This approach filters oils at the following rates per
my tests (all tests are with the 25mm nylon filters):</p>
<ol>
<li>MCT Oil<ol>
<li>With 10 -&gt; 5 mL compression (116 psi bubble point)<ul>
<li>45 mL in 44 mins (1.02 mL/min)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With 20 -&gt; 5 mL compression (73 psi bubble point)<ul>
<li>22 mL in 9.9 mins (2.22 mL/min)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Castor Oil<ol>
<li>With 20 -&gt; 5 mL compression (53 psi bubble point, flushed with 2mL MCT)<ul>
<li>10 mL in 65 mins (0.153 mL/min)</li>

</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T9JTHNK/">Caulk Gun</a><ul>
<li>You can buy cheaper caulk guns, but I like how well this one works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll also want some way to mount the caulk gun to be held up by itself if you are filtering castor oil, as it takes a while. Don't filter directly into final vials as
interrupting the flow of solution from the caulk gun is annoying and will drip solution
all over your workspace.</p>
<h3 id="procedure_1">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fill up your syringe with the desired amount of solution. For a 60mL syringe, use up to 45mL.</li>
<li>Select a compression ratio. Make sure the maximum PSI is less than the rating on your filter (which is typically 75-100 psi).<ul>
<li>10mL -&gt; 5mL (&lt;= 32 psi, safest but slower)</li>
<li>15mL -&gt; 5mL (&lt;= 48 psi)</li>
<li>20mL -&gt; 5mL (&lt;= 64 psi, pay attention not to overcompress)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draw up the larger amount of air listed in the compression ratio.</li>
<li>Attach the syringe filter to the syringe and attach the needle to the filter.</li>
<li>Insert the needle into your sterile vial.</li>
<li>Insert another needle (can be any smaller size) into the sterile vial to vent.</li>
<li>Insert the syringe assembly into the caulk gun so that the syringe body is inside the caulk gun.<ul>
<li>Do NOT insert the body of the syringe filter into the caulk gun, it should be outside it.</li>
<li>You may need to compress the syringe slightly to insert it into the caulk gun. If this is needed, ensure the syringe is upright while fitting it into the caulk gun and leave it upright from then on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the caulk gun to compress the syringe air bubble to the second number listed in the compression ratio.</li>
<li>If you have a mounting solution, prop the caulk gun up, making sure it doesn't restrict your ability to operate it.</li>
<li>Over time as filtration progresses, continue to re-compress the air bubble by operating the caulk gun. Be careful not to allow excessive compression, as that can burst the filter.</li>
<li>Once you are done filtering, release the caulk gun pressure and remove the needles from the vial.</li>
<li>Testing the bubble point of the syringe filter is highly recommended if you are using higher compression ratios or you feel you may have accidentally overcompressed the filter.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="vacuum-syringe-filtering">Vacuum Syringe Filtering</h2>
<p>In my adventures to make syringe filtering not an awful
hand-cramping experience and allow filtering of viscous oils, I have
tested a vacuum syringe filtering method. Why do this?</p>
<ol>
<li>Bottle top filters which are compatible with benzyl
    benzoate and/or MCT oil are somewhat costly and hard to find.</li>
<li>Many (but not all) bottle top filters have housings
    made of plastics which could possibly leech into your HRT due to
    incompatibility with solvents.</li>
<li>No more cramping your hands, you can filter large
    amounts of oil without making yourself miserable.</li>
<li>This approach maintains the advantages of syringe
    filters and pre-sterilized vials. You can keep everything post
    filtering factory-sterile and nothing ever needs to be washed which
    means saving time, effort, and makes the procedure significantly
    more dust resistant.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach filters oils at the following rates per
my tests:</p>
<ol>
<li>MCT Oil<ol>
<li>44.5 mL in 122 mins (0.37 mL/min)</li>
<li>8 mL in 9.75 mins (0.82 mL/min)</li>

<li>Castor Oil<ol>
<li>Nylon 25mm filter<ol>

<h3 id="pre-setup">Pre Setup</h3>
<h4 id="vacuum-filter">Vacuum Filter</h4>
<p>The vacuum filter comes with the incorrect size hose
connection for our filters. You’ll need to wrench off the connection
from the filter to the hose and replace it with the one that we
purchased. Make sure to use thread tape (included) on the new connection
and apply the hose clamp to the tube.</p>
<p>The existing hose connection that comes with the vacuum
pump is extremely fragile. You will likely destroy the brass hose
connection unless you use a box ended wrench. If you accidentally
destroy or strip it like I did, you can wrench off the entire filter and
connect the new hose connection directly to the vacuum pump. Of course,
if you do this, do not use the pump to filter anything explosive.</p>
<p>To test the vacuum pump, put your finger against the
hose and turn on the pump. If it can maintain suction for a few seconds,
the pump is working. (Ideally test this before starting the process, as
if the pump is not working finding out when you are about to filter
solution would be very bad.</p>
<h4 id="hose-to-luer-lock-adapter">Hose to Luer Lock Adapter</h4>
<p>Skip if you bought the finished adapter. The way this
works is you cut one of the 5mL syringes so that it has about an inch of
the tube left. Use thread tape, just thread the other hose adapter you
bought for the vacuum pump into the syringe body. Note there is a chance
you might crack the syringe when cutting it.</p>
<h3 id="procedure_2">Procedure</h3>
<p>Set up the syringe filter and hose as pictured and turn
on the vacuum pump:</p>
<p><img alt="A photo of a vial with a syringe filter inserted into a vial and another needle connected to the vacuum inserted into the vial." src="../img/vsf-setup.png" /></p>
<p>Try to keep the vial level on the desk and make sure
the needles are only poked into the filtering vial just slightly. You
don’t want the vacuum needle to reach down into the solution and send
your filtered solution into the vacuum pump.</p></div>
