Although technically illegal in countries like the US, authorities rarely prosecute individuals for personal use. Legal issues might only arise if testosterone is discovered during an unrelated search.<\/p>\n<p>In countries like Canada and the UK, personal possession of testosterone is legal, only distribution is prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>Ordering internationally poses a slight risk, as customs may confiscate the package. However, legal penalties are very rare. Typically, you&#8217;ll just receive a seizure notice. To avoid this, try to order from domestic sources, which are not subject to customs checks.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what_is_testosterone\"><\/div>\n<h1><strong>What is Testosterone?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Testosterone (T) is an anabolic steroid and masculinizing sex hormone.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what_does_it_do\">Everyone has both estrogen (E) and T, but cisgender men naturally produce more T than E. We want to achieve the same result through hormone replacement therapy.<\/div>\n<h1><strong>What does it do?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Testosterone induces both androgenic and anabolic effects.<\/p>\n<p>Androgenic effects are the masculinizing changes that come with taking testosterone, which includes clitoral enlargement (bottom growth), voice deepening, cessation of menstruation (stopping periods), increased definition of facial features and a more masculine fat distribution, facial and body hair growth, increased libido, acne, etc.<\/p>\n<p>You can think of anabolic effects as changes to your body&#8217;s metabolism, protein building and how it uses energy. Anabolic effects include increased muscle mass and strength, increased bone density, increased appetite, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The androgenic and anabolic effects of testosterone are about equal. You won&#8217;t necessarily have high levels of strength nor gain significant muscle mass, especially if you don&#8217;t exercise regularly.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what_methods\"><\/div>\n<h1><strong>What kind of methods can I get T in?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>There are multiple, each with their upsides and downsides, and levels of ease in terms of obtaining them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Injections<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>By far the most popular and well known method, injections are by far the easiest to come by if you choose to DIY. They are the easiest to consistently dose.<\/p>\n<p>There are certain esters testosterone is commonly compounded in. Testosterone is esterified in order to last longer in your body. Raw testosterone injected into your tissues will dissipate very quickly, which is why testosterone injections all come in ester form.<\/p>\n<p><b>Testosterone propionate, cypionate and enanthate are the most commonly prescribed and used testosterone esters.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We will only focus on cypionate and enanthate due to their long half lives (amount of time it lasts in your body). Testosterone cypionate and testosterone enanthate both have very similar strength and half lives.<\/p>\n<p>Cypionate&#8217;s half life is about 8 days when injected.<br \/>\nEnanthate&#8217;s half life is slightly shorter. Treat it similarly to cypionate. This means that for most people, it&#8217;s best to inject weekly for ideal hormone levels.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Gels<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This is harder to find in concentrations required to suppress estrogen on the grey\/black market. Also quite expensive if buying DIY. Usually harder to access because it is rare for most sources to carry gels. Fine for prescribed T.<\/p>\n<p>These come in packets or in a pump.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Pellets<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Not available from DIY sources (obviously), but are very effective if you can find a doctor that offers this form of testosterone.<\/p>\n<p>These are experimental in terms of dosages compared to the other tried and true methods. You can get them surgically implanted if your insurance covers it (or you are very wealthy).<br \/>\nThey let out a small dose of T each day and you don&#8217;t have to worry about missing a dose. They last about 3-6 months.<\/p>\n<div id=\"side_effects\"><\/div>\n<h1><strong>Risks\/Side effects<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><b>\u2757<i>Warning that taking testosterone will likely cause infertility, possibly irreversibly.<\/i><\/b><i>\u2757<\/i><\/p>\n<p>For a full list of potential increased risks of certain health issues associated with transmasculine HRT, you can refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftmguide.org\/tandhealth.html#sideeffects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this resource.<\/a><br \/>\nMost of the serious side effects are extremely low in absolute risk.<br \/>\n<strong>Polycythemia<\/strong> (high concentration of red blood cells in the blood) is a unique risk for transmascs taking any testosterone therapy. CBC (complete blood count) tests to monitor your hematocrit (red blood cell count) are recommended.<\/p>\n<p><b>What should my CBC look like?<\/b><br \/>\nPolycythemia is defined as serum hematocrit (Hct) or hemoglobin (HgB) exceeding normal ranges expected for age and sex, typically Hct &gt; 49% in healthy adult males. So there is no need to worry if you have Hct levels lower than that.<\/p>\n<p><b>Aromatization<\/b><br \/>\nIn all people, a small portion of the testosterone in their bodies is converted into estradiol (estrogen) through a process called aromatization. However, in healthy cisgender males, the testosterone levels typically remain within a range that does not cause a significant increase in estradiol levels, thereby mitigating any unwanted feminizing effects.<br \/>\nAs a transmasculine person,<strong> it&#8217;s important to not take too much testosterone<\/strong> (please stay within recommended dosage guidelines) to prevent estradiol levels from getting too high (which can cause unwanted feminizing effects).<br \/>\n<em>As long as you take reasonable dosages of testosterone and do not go over the recommended dosages, you are unlikely to deal with excessive aromatization.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"sourcing_dosing\"><\/div>\n<h1><strong>Sourcing\/Dosing:<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Ideally, you would be on T through legal means. However, you may not have the privilege, so this guide may be of use for you.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, if you are willing to attempt DIY, it is a preferable option to not being on T for many.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Prescribed T:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><b>You have to be 18+ to access informed consent services.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Informed consent ensures you understand all the information about a medical treatment and accept the risks involved.<br \/>\nInformed consent in the context of trans HRT means that the the effects of T (including risks and side effects) are explained to you by a medical professional. You can then agree or refuse starting T.<br \/>\nUnder an informed consent model, an adult is able to start T very quickly (within days or weeks of the first appointment) after they agree to receiving T treatment.<\/p>\n<p>See this short document for a full list for all current informed consent resources in the USA and worldwide: <a href=\"https:\/\/diyhrt.info\/informed-consent-telehealth\/\">Informed Consent and Telehealth<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To save on prescribed T in the USA, try <a href=\"https:\/\/goodrx.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goodrx.com<\/a> for free coupons to use at participating pharmacies.

You may need to learn how to buy Bitcoin. (If you are unable to, get a trusted friend to purchase the Bitcoin for you, or go to your local BTC ATM.) Some sites also offer payment in methods such as Zelle, Bank Transfer, Western Union and MoneyGram. (Keep in mind that these methods are often subject to minimum order requirements, unlike Bitcoin.)<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to order testosterone without a prescription, it will be illegal in most countries (although <strong>the risk of a domestic order being seized, let alone any person in possession of anabolic steroids for personal use being prosecuted, is unheard of<\/strong>). Testosterone <b>is legal<\/b> to possess without a prescription in places like the UK and Canada (sale of testosterone without a proper license <i>is<\/i> illegal, however).<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Dosing (gels):<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Here is a table of typical doses of testosterone gel used in transmasculine hormone therapy:<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-921 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/diyhrt.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/gel-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1062\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/diyhrt.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/gel-1.png 1062w, https:\/\/diyhrt.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/gel-1-300x89.png 300w, https:\/\/diyhrt.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/gel-1-1024x304.png 1024w, https:\/\/diyhrt.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/gel-1-768x228.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I recommend people start on ~50mg of testosterone gel per day, up to a maximum of 100mg\/day.<\/p>\n<p>Testosterone gel can be applied to the shoulders and upper arms, or the stomach area.

If your T vial shows up on a scanner, you may be charged with possession of a controlled substance.<\/p>\n<p>The absolute risk isn&#8217;t very high, but it&#8217;s best to try and stay on the safe side.<\/p>\n<p>If you MUST travel with DIY-sourced T, get a large clear Ziploc bag, have your T clearly labeled as testosterone, and throw in some aspirin and allergy meds inside with the T. Most likely airport security will not hound you for a prescription.<\/p>\n<p>If you are arrested, do not say anything to the police (but don&#8217;t make things up and lie to them) and contact a lawyer as soon as an opportunity is provided to you.<\/p>\n<p><b>Obviously, it is fine to travel with legitimately obtained, prescribed T. Just make sure you have the prescription with you.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Testosterone dosing after a hysterectomy.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Testosterone dosages do not usually need to be adjusted after a hysterectomy.<\/p>\n<p>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500<\/p>\n<footer><a href=\"mailto:diyhrtinfo@proton.me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get in touch: diyhrtinfo@proton.me<\/a><\/footer>\n<div class=\"notranslate\" style=\"all: initial;\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"notranslate\" style=\"all: initial;\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"notranslate\" style=\"all: initial;\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DIY HRT Directory Last Updated February 2025 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcdd Contents Introduction to DIY T: Legal Considerations: What is testosterone?
